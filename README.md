## 📌 Why CVEs Matter

- CVEs are used by **cybersecurity platforms**, **SIEMs**, and **vulnerability management tools** (like Tenable)
- They help **categorize, track, and prioritize** vulnerabilities
- CVEs can be **searched, referenced, and linked to patches** and exploit data
- Platforms often use **CVSS** scores (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) tied to each CVE to measure severity

## 🚨 Famous CVEs

These CVEs gained global attention due to their high impact:

| CVE | Name | Impact |

## 🏢 Who Manages CVEs?

- **MITRE** is the main organization behind CVEs.
- MITRE operates under the **U.S. Department of Homeland Security**.
- CVE records are fed into the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**, where they get enriched with CVSS scores, references, and patch info.
